Clean Code Basics in C#

Writing clean code means writing code that is easy to read, maintain, and extend. 
The following are some core principles of clean code in C#.

1. Meaningful Naming
Use clear and descriptive names for variables, methods, and classes.
Example:
    // Bad
    int d;

    // Good
    int daysSinceLastBackup;

2. Small and Focused Methods
Each method should perform a single, well-defined task.
Example:
    // Bad
    void ProcessDataAndSaveToFile() { }

    // Good
    void ProcessData() { }
    void SaveToFile() { }

3. Avoid Magic Numbers
Replace hard-coded numbers with named constants or enums.
Example:
    // Bad
    if (userType == 1) { }

    // Good
    if (userType == UserType.Admin) { }

4. Use Proper Formatting
Consistent indentation and spacing improve readability.

5. Write Comments Only When Needed
Explain WHY, not WHAT.

6. Keep Classes Small and Focused
Follow the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) â€” each class should have one reason to change.
